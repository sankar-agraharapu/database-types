    "# Handling Scalability Beyond 10TB\n",
    "\n",
    "As the database grows beyond 10TB, traditional relational databases might struggle with performance and management. To handle such large datasets, consider the following techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - **Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding)**: Split large tables across multiple databases or servers. Each shard contains a subset of the data, allowing for parallel processing and improved performance.\n",
    "   - **Vertical Partitioning**: Split a table into smaller tables containing fewer columns, which can improve performance for specific queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sharding**:\n",
    "   - Distribute data across multiple servers (shards) based on a shard key, such as `user_id`. This distributes the load and allows for horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Indexing**:\n",
    "   - Use indexes on frequently queried columns to improve read performance. However, be mindful of the trade-offs, as excessive indexing can slow down write operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Caching**:\n",
    "   - Implement caching layers (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the load on the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Archiving**:\n",
    "   - Move old or infrequently accessed data to an archive or data warehouse, keeping the active dataset smaller and more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Database Optimization**:\n",
    "   - Regularly optimize database queries, normalize tables, and monitor performance to ensure efficient data access and storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing these techniques, you can scale your relational database to handle larger datasets while maintaining performance and reliability.\n"
